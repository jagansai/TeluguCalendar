# Telugu Festival Reminder
This app reminds users of upcoming Telugu festivals. Main features include:
- Widget support for displaying week, thidhi, name of the year and festival ( if it is on current day )


# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

Clone the project and on windows / Linux, install powershell.  
Run for e.g., `scripts/deploy-android.ps1 Release -Format apk -FestivalsToken telugu/festivals`


#### Android build with single-source JSON (widget sync)

This script builds the Android app and copies the `assets/` folder to the right place for the widget to access it.

```sh

## Planned enhancements

Note: these are design notes for future work — documented here so we can pick them up later.

1) Tokenize UI labels for localization

- Goal: make all visible labels (for example: the Telugu labels `తిథి`, `సం`, `పండుగలు`, `ఈ రోజు`, `రాబోయే పండుగలు`) configurable via a small i18n layer so the app can be extended to other languages easily.
- Proposal: replace hard-coded label strings with lookups (example keys):
	- `label.today` (e.g. `"ఈ రోజు:"`)
	- `label.thidi` (e.g. `"తిథి:"`)
	- `label.year` (e.g. `"సం:"`)
	- `label.festivals` (e.g. `"పండుగలు:"`)
	- `label.upcoming` (e.g. `"రాబోయే పండుగలు (2 రోజుల్లో):"`)
- Implementation note: add a small `locales/` folder (for example `locales/en-ZA.json`, `locales/te-IN.json`) and a tiny lookup helper; default to the current Telugu strings where keys are missing.

These two changes make the festival data and UI strings extensible without large structural changes. We can implement them incrementally:
- Step 1: implement the runtime loader that accepts a token and merges matching `assets/` files.
- Step 2: add a small i18n helper and replace hard-coded labels with keys.
- Step 3: update build scripts to copy the right assets for Android widget packaging.

We can pick these up after the current release is live.

Notes:
- The Gradle build also runs the copy step automatically via the `preBuild` hook.
- You can still use `npm run android` to install & run; for CI or manual builds prefer the script above.

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
